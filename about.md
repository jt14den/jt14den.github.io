I am the Director of the UCLA Libraries Social Sciences Data Archive where I provide data services, including instruction, one-on-one consulting, and community building. I am a regular user of R, Python, SQL and command-line tools and have extensive experience helping researchers and students with these tools. I'm a qualified [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) instructor and tweet as [@jt14den](https://twitter.com/jt14den).
