##Chapter 2: Why it's better than it seems 

general education course
rousseau quote 
>>"hard to be shown up by a nineteen year old"

### why not?

outsmarted, asked quest can't answer, hours for every class, explain things wrong, trouble sleeping 

### What are the advantages of teaching outside expertise? 

Distinguish faculty within and outside 

content expert and content novice

simple division too simple

### Why Teach  OE 

1. Learn something new and interesting, most love to dig into new area , opportunity to dive into something of interest, gain better understanding as you teach it
2. Connect with faculty outside dept, v well be center of someone else's knowledge, make aquainces, 
3. Broaden you CV add new courses, you expand repertoire, versatile , could get shoehorned though
4. Devel a new area of research, maybe not gen ed or surveys but poss upper level 

### comfort categories:

* poised and confident - weren't sptressed, sought out OE
* undecide but untroubled - uncomfortable some of the Tim but not always
* straiged and anxious - don't like it at all tired and overstretched 
factors that dont matter: discipline 
, prior instructor, 

one factor beyond but 2 are
* had to teach it, new person etc
*  honest about it 


two principles on good **learning environment**
1. learn most when we drawn on their pre-existing understanding.  "no one is a blank slate". good learning environemtn brings out that understanding, challenges what's incorrect, and builds on the rest
2. learn most when instructors engage them on a few topics in-depth and provide them with examples as meaningful anchors, rather than a blizzard of topics and fleeitng specs
