On July 28, 2016, I presented to a UCSD empidemiology group at the Medical Teaching Facility on using the Stata package `estout` to autogenerate regression table for publication. `estout` is a Stata package that makes it easy to produce pubication quality regression tables in Stata. It also has provides various output formats including CSV, RTF, HTML or LaTeX.
