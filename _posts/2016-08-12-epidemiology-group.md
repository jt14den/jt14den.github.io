On July 28, 2016, I presented to a UCSD empidemiology group at the Medical Teaching Facility on using the Stata package `estout` to autogenerate regression table for publication. Check out the [slides](http://jt14den.github.io/finding-data/MTF175.html#1) for the talk and the [code](https://github.com/jt14den/estout/blob/master/esttab.md).
