I became an instructor trainer in the Carpentries in Spring of 2017 and since then I've co-taught 5 train-the-trainer events. These trainings teach research-based teaching practices the Carpentries use and we also spend time orienting workshop participants to how the Carpentries operate. Once learners finish this class and a few check-out steps (discuss & contribute to a lesson, teach a demo) they become a certified (badged) instructor in the carpentries. I finished teaching a workshop with Jeff Oliver, University of Arizona, this past week, but wanted to write up a few notes on the other ones I taught and add the links to the materials for easier reference.

## Past

1. April, 24 & 26 2017 Online - Co-instructor: Christina Koch (@christinalk) website: <https://jt14den.github.io/2017-04-24-ttt-online-vatech-nist/>;
    - This training had groups from Virginia Tech and the National Institute of Standards and Technology. Luckily, I was paired with Christina Koch on my first instructor training - she def. helped me make it through and deal with the artificial nature of teaching online.
1. May 4-5, 2017 Portland, OR - Co-instructor Belinda Weaver (@weaverbel) website: <https://weaverbel.github.io/2017-05-04-portland-ttt/>
    - This event was organized by John Chodacki and happened directly after CSV;Conf. It was focused on training librarians to become certified and teach Library Carpentry Workshops.  I was fortunate to teach with Belinda Weaver (@weaverbel) with help from Juliane Schneider (@pitviper6) and John Chodacki (@chodacki). So far, 18 learners from this cohort certified and many have taught Library Carpentry. I personally participated or taught in Carpentries workshops with 8 instructors since the Portland event.
1. Oct. 9, 2017 North West University, Potchefstroom, South Africa - Juan Steyn (@zjsteyn), Anelda van der Walt (@anelda), <https://nwu-eresearch.github.io/2017-10-09-NWU-eResearch-ttt/>
    - This opportunity to teach and present in South Africa came about by the work of the [African Task Force](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/regional_communities/african_task_force.html), the highly impactful group that is organizing Carpentries workshops and instructors in the African continent. During this trip, we taught two Library Carpentry workshops and the above instructor training event. I even had the opportunity of giving a key note at the annual Library and Information Association of South Africa (LIASA) Conference. More than anything, I met some great people, including Erika Mias (@erikamias), Kayleigh Lino (@curatorkay), Juan Steyn (@zjsteyn) and Anelda van der Walt (@anelda).
1. July 18, 2018 - online - Jeff Coliver (@jcoliver) - <https://jcoliver.github.io/2018-07-18-ttt-online/>
    - This training had groups from Columbia, Army Corps of Engineer - Engineer R&D Center, and University of Miami. Teaching with Jeff is wonderful because he's so even-keeled and unflappable. He definitely grounded the workshop in a solid knowledge of pedagogy and the Carpentries. 
1. Oct. 10-11, 2018 online - Jeff Coliver (@jcoliver) - <https://jcoliver.github.io/2018-10-10-ttt-online-PST/>
    - This was the first fully distributed online training for me -- every learner in a separate location via Zoom. We definitely got practice with Zoom's breakout feature and by the second day it was routine. Learners did say they missed some of the personal interaction you'd get in a grouped online model, but this format is necessary for individuals who might not be near others in a training.
