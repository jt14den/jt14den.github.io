title: "Library Carpentry sprint, 2 Oct, 2017 - LiASA"
author: ["Belinda Weaver", "Tim Dennis"]

The Library Carpentry sprint is part of the [Library and Information Association of South Africa 2017 Conference](http://www.liasa.org.za/18th-liasa-annual-conference-programme/), which will take place on 2 October, 2017 in Johannesburg. For those new to the field, a sprint is like a hackathon - it is a way to get people working together to create, update or extend open projects like Library Carpentry.

We are using this sprint to give participants an introduction to Library Carpentry, cover how the community works and how to get involved.  We'll also provide details on how to host and organise a workshop and hands-on exercises in setting up a workshop website. Following workshop operations, we'll shift to explore how Library Carpentry lessons are collaboratively created and maintain. We'll amend, update, extend and improve the existing [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/) lessons. Along the way, you'll learn how to collaborate in GitHub and make your own blog. Finally, we'll conclude with the a preliminary outline for a follow-up workshop during the first quarter of 2018.

We welcome contributions from librarians, archivists, information professionals, digital humanities researchers ... anyone who wants to contribute to building the lessons and this burgeoning community.

### Workshop goals 

* Intro to Library Carpentry
* A warm and welcoming environment (code of conduct)

### How will the sprint work?

We will use our Gitter to chat with each other. Library Carpentry has 3 gitters:

* [The Lobby](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/Lobby) - General topical disuccsions on library carpentry
* [Lesson Development](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/lesson-dev) - discussions related to creating and maintaining our lessons 
* [Workshops](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/workshops) - a chat for putting on and feedback around workshops

We will also this etherpad <http://pad.software-carpentry.org/lc-south-africa-sprint> to share links & notes and organize work. Join the chatroom at any time using your GitHub username or your Twitter handle. 

### Social Media and Communications

The sprint hashtag is **#lc-sa2017**. Please use this to tie tweets together, and also use
Library Carpentry's Twitter handle, [**@LibCarpentry**](https://twitter.com/LibCarpentry), if you can.

### Next steps 

#### Put on a workshop - no matter how big or small 

* You can do this! Teaching to learn is the new norm in Academia 
* The [Workshops](https://gitter.im/LibraryCarpentry/workshops) gitter is there to help 
* Follow the Software Carpentry Operations manual: <https://software-carpentry.org/workshops/operations/>
* Pick a room, get a date and make it happen 

#### Work on existing lessons by
- **submitting pull requests** to suggest changes (please keep each pull request small - one or two changes only per PR - to make them easier to manage for maintainers)
- **raising issues** for discussion/amendment against specific lessons using the *Issues* tab on each lesson
- **chatting with others** in the chatroom or via the daily catchups and video calls
- **working through lessons with colleagues** as a way of familiarising yourself with the material
- **discussing the project with colleagues**, especially about how you might bring Library Carpentry to your institution
- **identifying any confusing gaps or assumptions** in lessons so we can make the lessons more learner-friendly.
