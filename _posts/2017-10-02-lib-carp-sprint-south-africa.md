title: "Library Carpentry sprint, 2 Oct, 2017"
author: ["Belinda Weaver", "Tim Dennis"]

The Library Carpentry sprint is part of the [Library and Information Association of South Africa 2017 Conference](http://www.liasa.org.za/18th-liasa-annual-conference-programme/), which will take place on 2 October, 2017 in Johannesburg. For those new to the field, a sprint is like a hackathon - it is a way to get people working together to create, update or extend open projects like Library Carpentry.

We are using this sprint to give participants an introduction to Library Carpentry, cover how the community works and how to get involved.  We'll also provide details on how to host and organise a workshop and hands-on exercises in setting up a workshop website. Following workshop operations, we'll shift to explore how Library Carpentry lessons are collaboratively created and maintain. We'll amend, update, extend and improve the existing [Library Carpentry](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/) lessons. Along the way, you'll learn how to collaborate in GitHub and make your own blog. Finally, we'll conclude with the a preliminary outline for a follow-up workshop during the first quarter of 2018.

We welcome contributions from librarians, archivists, information professionals, digital humanities researchers ... anyone who wants to contribute to building the lessons and this burgeoning community.

Not sure what Library Carpentry is? Check out our ['front page'](https://librarycarpentry.github.io/). This provides links to the published lessons. For the 'back end', repository view of the lessons, check out the lessons prefixed `library-` or `dh-` [here](https://github.com/data-lessons).

**How will the sprint work?**

We will use our [chatroom](https://gitter.im/weaverbel/LibraryCarpentry) and this [GitHub repository](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry) to organise work during the 2-day sprint. Join the chatroom at any time using your GitHub username or your Twitter handle. These are the [issues](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry/issues) we want to work on during the sprint. To find out how you can help, look at the [README](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry/blob/master/README.md) and [CONTRIBUTING](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) files. The [issues](https://github.com/data-lessons/librarycarpentry/issues) we hope to resolve are all labelled **#mozsprint**. Feel free to create new issues if you need to.

**What you can do**

Work on existing lessons by
- **submitting pull requests** to suggest changes (please keep each pull request small - one or two changes only per PR - to make them easier to manage for maintainers)
- **raising issues** for discussion/amendment against specific lessons using the *Issues* tab on each lesson
- **chatting with others** in the chatroom or via the daily catchups and video calls
- **working through lessons with colleagues** as a way of familiarising yourself with the material
- **discussing the project with colleagues**, especially about how you might bring Library Carpentry to your institution
- **identifying any confusing gaps or assumptions** in lessons so we can make the lessons more learner-friendly.

**Social Media and Communications**

The sprint hashtag is **#lc-sa2017**. Please use this to tie tweets together, and also use
Library Carpentry's Twitter handle, [**@LibCarpentry**](https://twitter.com/LibCarpentry), if you can.

**Lesson Maintainers**

This is a list of people who maintain each Library Carpentry lesson. If you are editing a lesson, be sure to check in with them throughout the sprint. Volunteers to help maintain a lesson after the sprint are always welcome!
